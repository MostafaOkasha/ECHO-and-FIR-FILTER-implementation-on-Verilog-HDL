# ECHO-and-FIR-FILTER-implementation-on-Verilog-HDL

##ABOUT:

This is my attempt at implementing an ECHO machine and an FIR filter which filters out a specific frequency using Verilog HDL on the ALTERA DE2 board. What makes this complex is the need to understand the physical mechanisms behind an ECHO and an FIR filter.

This was performed as part of a McMaster University, Mechatronics Engineering Project.
